Biskit is a lazy dog, but he has a sharp brain!

In between lounging and lazing Biskit keeps his mind sharp by doing the AC Jumble. The AC Jumble is a little different than a typical jumble. You are given two words, if one of the words can be rearranged to equal the other Biskit shouts 'AC JUMBLE'. If the two words can't be rearranged to be equal, then Biskits finds the lowest cost it would take to convert one of the words into a AC JUMBLE of the other and shouts that. The cost of converting one letter to another is the number of letter's they are separated from each other in the alphabet. If one word is bigger than the other, the cost to add letters to a shorter string is just that letter's position in the alphabet (i.e a = 1). In AC Jumble you can't make a word shorter!
